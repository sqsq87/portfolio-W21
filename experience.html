			<h2>Experience as a voluntary teacher</h2>
		<p>In 2018 Winter, I went to ErYuan county in YunNan Province, serving as an voluntary primary school English teacher there. 
			Because of its remote location, the English education there is still backward. 
			I was very honored to share my English learning experience during my primary school with the local English teachers and give English lessons to the primary school students there. 
			I also made friends with many primary school students, their pure smile deeply impressed me. </p>

			<h2>Journey in Yunnan</h2>
			<p>Besides, I also used this oppotunity to visit Yunnan, one of the most beautiful provinces in China. </p>

				<h3>At Erhai</h3>
				<p>
					Erhai is located in Dali bai autonomous prefecture in Yunan Province and it is the second largest highland lake in Yunnan.
					Looking down from the sky, Erhai is like a new moon, lying quietly between Cangshan and Dali Bazi. 
					Because of its clear water and high transparency, it has been called "flawless jade among mountains" since ancient times.
					I was deeply impressed by the beautiful scenery there, feeling an unprecedented sense of peace and quietness.

				<h3>At Jade Dragon Snow Mountain</h3>
				<p>
					Jade Dragon Snow Mountain is the snow mountain closest to the equator.
					Its 13 snow peaks are continuous, just like a "dragon" flying, so it is called "jade dragon". 
					It's the holy mountain of Naxi people, which is said to be the incarnation of the protection god of Naxi people.
					During my journey, I succeeded in climbing to one of the top whose altitude is 4680 meter.
