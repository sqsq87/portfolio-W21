		<h1 id='main'>My lovely pets</h1>
		<p>I have two dogs. They are both boys.</p>
		<div class='dog1'>
		<p>The name of my first dog is Gao Gao and he is eight years old now.
			He came to my home during the first year of my senior high school. 
			He is a white dog with some black patterns on its head. 
			He is very clever. He knows how to shake hands, how to guard the entrance.
			He loves eating yogurt and sleeping on sofa.</p>

		<div class='dog2'>
		<p>
			The name of another dog is Le Le. He come to my home duing the second year of my senior high school.
			He is a brown dog. He likes eating and he can eat a lot, so he is a little fat.
			Although he is stronger than Gao Gao, he is very kind to Gao Gao and is willing to share food with him. 
			The most interesting of him is that he can quickly fall sleep even if he is sitting.

	  <p>My two dogs have accompanied me since my high school year. Although they can not speak, they can feel my emotions and give me warmness when I am not happy. They are my family members and best friends.
