		<p>After my college-entrance examination, I entered Shanghai JiaoTong Universiity and stayed there for four years as an undergraduate. My institute is University of Michigan-Shanghai Jiaotong University Joint Institute. My undergraduate major is electrical and computer engineering.
			 Thanks to my undergraduate univerisity and institute, I have learned much about programming, circuit, computer, but most importantly, how to collaborate with others to complete a big project. 
			 It is also these four years inspiring me to apply for a master program in the University of Michigan.
